# Electrical Engineering Pointer Visualizer

## Description

Electrical Engineering Pointer Visualizer is a web-based tool designed for engineers, educators, and students in the field of electrical engineering. This interactive platform allows users to visualize and manipulate pointer images commonly used in electrical engineering studies, such as phasors, vector diagrams, and signal representations.

## Features

- **Interactive Pointer Visualization:** Create and manipulate pointer images with real-time visual feedback.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust parameters like magnitude, angle, and frequency to see their effects on the pointers.
- **Educational Resources:** Access a library of pre-built examples and tutorials to enhance learning.
- **Export Options:** Save your pointer diagrams as images for use in reports or presentations.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for both beginners and experienced users.

## Getting Started
